# iOS custom native module

Lets build the same native module that we built for android last chapter. The purpose remains the same, the native module should get you the device name set on the iPhone.

Before we continue, just a reminder if you want to write code for iOS, please open the iOS project on Xcode.
This is because Xcode is built for ios development and it will help you resolve all the trivial errors that otherwise would take up your time.

Lets begin.

1. Open the `./ios/` project folder. Open .xcodeproj file or .xcworkspace file in Xcode.

2. Create a header file `Device.h` by
 `File -> New -> File -> Header File` and then name the file `Device.h` and choose the targets. Create a new folder Device if you like to organise files in a folder like me.
 <div style="text-align:center">
   <img src="/assets/images/16/16.2/16.2-ios-setup.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
 </div>
 <br>

Let modify our `Device.h` file.
  **`ios/Device/Device.h`**
  ```c
  #import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>

  @interface Device : NSObject <RCTBridgeModule>
  @end
  ```
  This is our main custom native modules header file.

Now lets create the corresponding implementation file `Device.m` in the same location.
  **`ios/Device/Device.m`**
  ```c
  #import "Device.h"

  @implementation Device

  RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();

  @end
  ```
Like the android's getName method, Here we have RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() macro. If no name is explicitly provided it will take the name of the module. Here the name of the module is 'Device'.

In order to expose a method from native module to javascript just write a method inside the RCT_EXPORT_METHOD macro. These methods can be accessed from `NativeModules` of `react-native` package.

See the below example:

**`ios/Device/Device.m`**
```c
#import "Device.h"
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@implementation Device

//export the name of the native module as 'Device' since no explicit name is mentioned
RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();

//exports a method getDeviceName to javascript
RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(getDeviceName:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback){
  @try{
    NSString *deviceName = [[UIDevice currentDevice] name];
    callback(@[[NSNull null], deviceName]);
  }
  @catch(NSException *exception){
    callback(@[exception.reason, [NSNull null]]);
  }
}

@end
```


Here we are exporting a method `getDeviceName()` from native to javascript.
This method can be accessed in js as
```js
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
NativeModules.Device.getDeviceName((err ,name) => {
    console.log(err, name);
});
```

NativeModules has a key named 'Device'. This is basically the same name exported by RCT_EXPORT_METHOD.

We passed a callback to get the value from the NativeModule.

Thats it, lets give it a shot!.

In a javascript file like **`app/index.js`**
just add

```js

import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
...
...
NativeModules.Device.getDeviceName((err, name) => console.log(err, name));
...
...
```

Running this on an android emulator returns.

</div>
<br>


Woot ! That was simple !
