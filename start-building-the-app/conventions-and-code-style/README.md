# Conventions and Code Style 🎓

Every team is composed of developers who follow different conventions. Hence, we often find that code written by a developer is not easily understood by another developer on the same team. **Not having a proper convention creates dependencies on individuals and makes the project difficult to understand by a newcomer**. Tight dependencies in a software development project can affect the velocity of the team.

The best way to solve this is by deciding and following code conventions.

> We strongly believe that NO convention is bad. As long as there is some convention and it is followed religiously, it is good.

Code conventions can be as easy as following 4 spaces instead of tabs, or always ending a statement with a semicolon, etc. It could also be something more complex like not allowing `setState()` to be invoked on `componentWillMount` of a React Component.

_So if you want your team to code like this guy, set and follow conventions._
