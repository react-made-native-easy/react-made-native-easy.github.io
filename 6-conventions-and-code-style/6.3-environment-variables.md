# Environment variables

Since react-native combines native platform code with JS, you might find it hard to accomplish small tasks like passing environment variables. But don't worry, we have you covered here as well. 🙌

### How do Environment variables work in react-native?

Since the JS code is being executed by the native platform, we cannot directly pass env variables like we used to in node/Webpack projects. So we found an alternative way to accomplish this.

### How to use Environment variables in RN?
We created an `env.config.js` file which exports an object. The env object can contain the API base URL, environment, and even the app fixtures/mock API data, etc. And on the CI (Travis in our case), we change the contents of the file depending on the build type(Dev, UAT or Prod). Sounds cool right? 🤓

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/6/6.3/env-structure.png" style="width: 50%;display:inline-block;vertical-align: middle;margin:0" hspace="40">
</div>

The app will contain all the env configs inside `environment/` folder. The CI will replace the contents of `env.config.js` with `environment/prod.config.js` before starting the build process.

### How to change env config using TravisCI?

The command is pretty simple. All we need to do is copy the contents of one file to another.
```shell
cp app/config/env/prod.env.js app/config/env.config.js
```
Head over to [TravisCI]() chapter to know how and where to put the above-mentioned command.
