# Conventions

Every team composes of developers who follow different conventions. Hence, often we find that code written by a developer is not easily understood by another developer in the same team. **Not having a proper convention creates dependencies on individuals and makes the project difficult to understand by a newcomer**. Tight dependencies in a software development project can affect the velocity of the team.

The best way to solve this is by deciding and following code conventions.

> We strongly believe that NO convention is bad.
> As long as there is some convention and it is followed religiously, its good.

Code conventions can be as easy as following 4 spaces instead of tabs, or ending a statement always with semicolon, etc. It could also be something more complex like not allowing `setState()`to be invoked on `componentWillMount`of a React Component.
